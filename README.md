# Claude Code CLI in Docker

A comprehensive dockerized Claude Code CLI with full development toolchain for Python and C++ projects.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Build once
```bash
./build.sh
```

### Run on the current repo
```bash
./run-claude.sh
```
This opens the Claude REPL in your terminal at /work (your repo).

First run will ask you to auth Claude Code in a browser. Your session persists in ~/.claude.

### One-shot commands
```bash
./run-claude.sh -p "Analyze this codebase"
./run-claude.sh -p "Generate unit tests for main.cpp"
./run-claude.sh -p "Review code for security issues"
```

### Continue last session
```bash
./run-claude.sh --continue
```

### Advanced flags
```bash
--permission-mode [ask|plan|skip]   # Control how Claude handles dangerous operations
--model claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620  # Specify model version
--max-turns 10                      # Limit conversation length
--allowedTools shell,fs,git         # Restrict tool access
```

## üì¶ Standalone Usage

Copy `standalone/claude-docker.sh` into any repo and run it there for a portable solution that automatically builds the image if needed.

```bash
# Copy to any project
cp standalone/claude-docker.sh /path/to/your/project/
cd /path/to/your/project/
./claude-docker.sh -p "Analyze this project and suggest improvements"
```

## üìÅ Directory Structure

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Permission errors**: Build runs with your UID/GID to avoid file ownership issues
- **SSH not working**: Ensure SSH agent is running or ~/.ssh exists  
- **GitHub auth**: Run `gh auth login` on host before mounting config
- **Large builds**: Increase Docker resource limits if builds fail
